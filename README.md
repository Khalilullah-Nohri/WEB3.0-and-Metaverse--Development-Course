### Introduction to Web3.0 and Metaverse

We began our journey with an introduction to Web3.0, Metaverse, and Blockchain technology to set the stage for the upcoming topics.

### HTML5 and CSS3

We delved into the world of modern web development, exploring HTML5 and CSS3. We learned to create structurally sound and visually appealing web pages. Our focus was on responsiveness, employing technologies like Flexbox and Media Queries to ensure our web designs adapt to various screen sizes.

### JavaScript Mastery

Our training included a deep dive into JavaScript. We embarked on this journey with the book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript" by Mark Myers. This comprehensive guide helped us build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

### Advanced JavaScript (ES6)

Building upon our JavaScript knowledge, we explored the latest features and enhancements introduced in ES6. This advanced JavaScript version empowers us to write cleaner, more efficient code.

### Web Hosting with Firebase

We learned how to host websites using Firebase Hosting, a robust and user-friendly platform. This practical skill allows us to deploy our projects for the world to see.

### Assignments and Version Control

Throughout the training, we engaged in hands-on assignments to reinforce our learning. We also utilized Git, a popular version control system, to manage and upload our assignments.

### Quizzes and Assessments

To gauge our understanding, we took quizzes upon completing each technology. These assessments helped us track our progress and identify areas for improvement.
